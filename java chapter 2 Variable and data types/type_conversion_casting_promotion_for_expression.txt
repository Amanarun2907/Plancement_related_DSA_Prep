Type conversion in Java is the process of converting one data type into another.
There are two main types:

Implicit Type Conversion (Widening)
This happens automatically when you assign a smaller data type to a larger data type. 
There's no data loss in this conversion.
code---->
int num = 10;
double doubleNum = num; // int is converted to double
System.out.println(doubleNum); 

2. Explicit Type Conversion (Narrowing)
This requires explicit casting because there's a risk of data loss. 
You convert a larger data type into a smaller data type.
code--->
double doubleNum = 10.5;
int num = (int) doubleNum; // double is cast to int
System.out.println(num); // Output: 10 (decimal part is lost)
Implicit Conversion: Safe and automatic.
Explicit Conversion: Needs a cast and can lead to data loss.

Type promotion in Java is when smaller data types are automatically converted to larger data types in expressions. 
This ensures that operations are performed accurately without data loss.
 int a = 5;
double b = 6.2;
double result = a + b; // 'a' (int) is promoted to 'double' before addition
System.out.println(result);
