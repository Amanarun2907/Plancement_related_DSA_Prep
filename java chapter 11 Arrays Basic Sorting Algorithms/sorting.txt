Sorting in Arrays

Sorting is the process of arranging elements of a list or array in a specific order, typically ascending or descending.

Bubble Sort
How it works:
Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Repeats this process until no more swaps are needed.
The largest element "bubbles" to the end of the array in each pass.


Selection Sort
How it works:
Finds the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array.
Swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part.
Repeats this process for the remaining unsorted part.

Insertion Sort
How it works:
Iterates through the array, starting from the second element.
Compares the current element with the elements before it.
Shifts larger elements one position to the right.
Inserts the current element in its correct position.

Counting Sort
How it works:
Determines the maximum value in the array.
Creates a count array to store the frequency of each element.
Modifies the count array to store the cumulative frequency.
Iterates through the input array and places each element in its correct position in the output array based on the modified count array.


Sorting Algorithms and Their Time Complexities

Bubble Sort
How it works: Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Time Complexity:
Best case: O(n) (when the array is already sorted)
Average case: O(n²)
Worst case: O(n²)

Selection Sort
How it works: Finds the minimum element in the unsorted part and swaps it with the first element.
Time Complexity:
Best case: O(n²)
Average case: O(n²)
Worst case: O(n²)

Insertion Sort
How it works: Iterates through the array, inserting each element into its correct position relative to the sorted portion.
Time Complexity:
Best case: O(n) (when the array is already sorted)
Average case: O(n²)
Worst case: O(n²)

Counting Sort
How it works: Counts the occurrences of each element and uses the count information to place elements in their correct positions.
Time Complexity: O(n + k), where n is the number of elements and k is the range of input values. It's efficient for a specific range of input values.
